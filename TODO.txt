Find a library for config files
============================================

Our config file looks like this:

    800

That sucks! We want it to look nicer; for instance, it could look like this:

    width 800
    height 400

But, holy cow. We'd have to really change our logic, and introduce either 
case statements or working with hashes.

This seems like a problem that a lot of people must have all of the time, 
for almost every project: how to load config files. There must be a ruby 
gem out there for this!
 

How to handle 4, 20, 50 or 100 moving images instead of 1
=========================================================

We're drawing one image right now. To do that, in our draw method,
we reference three variables. They are:

    @bg, @x, @y

That's okay for now. 

But what if you had a directory full of little pictures, and you wanted 
them to all 'walk' around the screen at once?

Imagine typing

    @img27, @x27, @y27 = Gosu::Image..., 0, 0

100 times in the initialize function, and in the update function:

    @x27 += rand
    @y27 += rand

100 times to make it move, and in the draw function:

    @img27.draw @x27, @y27

one hundred times ... obviously, that would stink.

Really, wouldn't it be nice if supporting 100 moving images was as simple
as this?

    def update
      @images.each do |img|
        img.move_in_a_random_direction
      end
    end
    
    def draw
      @images.each do |img|
        img.draw              # sweet, it knows how to 
      end
    end

Well -- aside from a little bit of work in the initialize() method, it 
WILL be that simple. Because we're going to build our own Image class, 
and then instantiate many of them with images from a directory.

(Remember, we talked about Classes/Instances before -- `class Animal`,
`class Human < Animal`).

From the code snippet above, we can already see that it'll need:

    - to be initialized with a filename, x and y arguments
    - to keep track of its own x and y attributes
    - to have a `move` method that wraps up random movement
    - to have a `draw` method that wraps up drawing to its location

So we'll probably want to make a file, `models.rb`, where we'll start 
writing this class:

    class MovableImage
      def initialize
        # here be dragons!
      end
      # here too!
    end

From there we'll pair-program a bit.

As to 'why would I make a MovableImage class?', there's a WONDERFUL
reason. For instance, imagine a video game. How many of the images on
screen need to keep track of their locations in the fashion described?

Probably all of them. The Heads-Up Display, the hero and enemy characters,
the background, the "Ready, Set, Go!" at the beginning of a level ...
they all share some similar behavior. And, poof, the crazy complexity of 
keeping track of dozens or hundreds of different resources gets reduced
to defining how one or two different TYPES of things behave.

Again, we'll pair-program. But if you meditate a bit on this section,
it'll feel more familiar when we do this.
